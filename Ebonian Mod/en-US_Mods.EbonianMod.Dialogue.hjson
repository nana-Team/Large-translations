	WizardAboutX1: Hah! The martians really did a number on old Xareus... What a fool.
	WizardAboutX2: Hm, I see you've taken care of that idiotic 'Archmage'... Good job!
	WizardAboutX3: So you�ve met the so-called �archmage�. Pah! He couldn�t cast with an amethyst staff!
	WizardAboutX4: The �apex of magic� as he calls himself is just a monument to hubris! I�ve seen slimes more magical!
	WizardAboutX5: That fool is still out there? Pay him little mind, or else you�ll never hear the end of it!
	WizardAboutX6: You really oughta look into that abandoned looking purple shack, if I recall right, it was the home of an incredibly reckless freak.
	WizardAboutX7: Have you still not checked up on that weird purple shack? A self proclaimed 'Archmage' dwells there.
	WizardAboutX8: As much as I despise Xareus, his sheepening spell is quite... fascinating, to say the least.

	XIntro8: LEAVE ME ALONE!
	XIntro9: Dude, please, it's like midnight, I'm so tired of winning...
	XIntro10: I thought the first time taught you a proper lesson!
	XTaunt1: If I were you, I would probably try to steal my staff too!
	XTaunt2: This is nothing but a slight inconvenience for the Grand Archmage!!
	XTaunt3: If only you were as good at fighting as you were at opening doors!
	XTaunt4: You're practically defeating YOURSELF!
	XTaunt5: Are you intentionally missing? Or is my glory blinding you?
	XTaunt6: You're unworthy of even witnessing my greatest magic!
	XTaunt7: My greatest magics would break your mind BEFORE your body!
	XTaunt8: I bet you can't even begin to comprehend the might of The Archmage!
	XTaunt9: Your greatest skill is your ability to make bad decisions!
	XTaunt10: If I were you, I'd bow and let me destroy you!
	XTaunt11: I can't believe I'm wasting all my glory on this...
	XTaunt12: Even if you stole it, you would never be worthy enough to wield my Magnificent Staff!
	XTaunt13: I'm not sure whether your futile attempts to hurt me are depressing or amusing!
	XTaunt14: I've yet to meet someone that can outsmart spells!
	XTaunt15: You're not putting a scratch on me!
	XTaunt16: Feel the power of my MAAAGIIIC!!!
	XTaunt17: You truly are an amateur among amateurs!
	XTaunt18: There is no mercy for thieves like you!
	XTaunt19: If you surrender now, I still won't consider letting you go!
	XTaunt20: There is no escape, weakling!
	XTaunt21: My power is MAXIMUM!!!!!!!!
	XTaunt22: Unbelievable! I almost envy your persistence!
	XTaunt23: Unlike you, I am destined for supremacy!

	XTaunt28: Y-you think some fire is e-enough to take down the GRAND A-ARCHMAGE!?
	XTaunt29: Hey! QUIT IT! You're scratching up my robe!
	XTaunt30: My potions are too strong for you!
	XTaunt31: I remember a RAT that was better with magic!
	XTaunt32: Even a bunny outmatches you in magic prowess!
	XTaunt33: Maybe hone your spells before facing the Grand Archmage!
	XTaunt34: You call THAT magic?! How pitiful!
	XTaunt35: My staff is bigger than yours!
	XTaunt36: You'd be better off using that staff to club me!
	XTaunt37: For a sorcerer, your power disappoints me...
	XTaunt38: A brute like you is unworthy to face someone like me!
	XTaunt39: Your strikes are but empty threats to one such as myself!
	XTaunt40: A measly blade is all you'll ever be good for!
	XTaunt41: Oh, WHAT?! Is the sword too heavy for your flabby noodle arms?!?
	XTaunt42: Stay true to your aim, then maybe you'll stand a chance!
	XTaunt43: Your firepower is nothing compared to the might of my magic!
	XTaunt44: Your aim is a disgrace to a disgrace!
	XTaunt45: Are you TRYING to hit the wall? Or are you just blinded by my glory?
	XTaunt46: You fool! I am bulletproof!
	XTaunt47: I would make a better archer than you!
	XTaunt48: WHAT THE HELL?!
	XTaunt49: STOP GOING FOR CHEAP SHOTS, YOU LITTLE BANDIT!
	XTaunt50: How about I whip YOU into shape?!
	XTaunt51: Coward! Strength in numbers is futile against ME!!!
	XTaunt52: You dare face me with your sinister spawns?!
	XTaunt53: You attack me with MINIONS? AT LEAST FACE ME YOURSELF!
	XTaunt54: How actually DARE you! WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF I SWARMED YOU WITH MINIONS?!
